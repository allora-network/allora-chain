<!--
Guiding Principles:

Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
There should be an entry for every single version.
The same types of changes should be grouped.
Versions and sections should be linkable.
The latest version comes first.
The release date of each version is displayed.
Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning (we do at and after v1.0.0).

Usage:

Change log entries are to be added to the Unreleased section
under the appropriate stanza (see below).
Each entry should ideally include the Github issue or PR reference.

The issue numbers will later be link-ified during the
release process so you do not have to worry about including
a link manually, but you can if you wish.

Types of changes (Stanzas):

* __Added__ for new features.
* __Changed__ for changes in existing functionality that did not aim to resolve bugs.
* __Deprecated__ for soon-to-be removed features.
* __Removed__ for now removed features.
* __Fixed__ for any bug fixes that did not threaten user funds or chain continuity.
* __Security__ for any bug fixes that did threaten user funds or chain continuity.

Breaking changes affecting client, API, and state should be mentioned in the release notes.

## v0.4.0

### Summary

Implements fixes for our [June 2024](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora-judging) Sherlock.xyz audit, including important fixes for determining which topics are considered active.

### Added
