# Release Signing Keys

This directory contains the PGP keys used to sign releases of the `allora-chain` project.

You can import the key by running `gpg --import <key>`.

You can check that the signature was created by the key by running `gpg --verify <signature> <release>`. Signatures can be found in the `*.asc` files in the release assets.

Releases and their assets can be taken from the [releases page](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain/releases).
